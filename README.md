# cellsociety 

Project Information
======

*Authors*: Rachel Bransom, Diane Hadley, George Bernard

*Main class file*: Main.java

How to Use
======
Follow the instructions by using the drop down menus labeled 'CHOOSE XML FILE' and 'CHOOSE CELL SHAPE' to choose which theme and cell shape to use in the simulation. To start the simulation running click 'RESET' and press 'PLAY'.

The user can pause the simulation, or go through it step by step using the buttons 'STOP' and 'STEP'. The user can also adjust the speed of the simulation by using the 'ADJUST SPEED' slider.

The user can choose how to initliaze the cells; whether by using the states given in the selected XML file, or by random selection.

Visually, the user can choose to include grid lines around each cell or not, but selecting/deselecting the 'GRID LINES' checkbox. The user can also choose the color scheme to use in the simulation by using the radio buttons and choosing between 'NORMAL', 'BRIGHTEN', 'DARKEN', 'SATURATE', 'GRAYSCALE', and 'INVERT'.
